// Values and Variables //

// What is a Value ??
// Value is the most fundamental unit of information in programming, essentially a piece data.

// What is a Variable ?
// variable is what holds the data's refrence to refer it in future.
// A variable is a labeled container for storing a value.
// This label can be used later to access the stored value.

// variables are the storage buckets with a lable attached that can be used to recall a value stored in that bucket.

"Divyansh" // this is a vlaue // but you are not doing anything here.

console.log("MyName"); // 'MyName' here is a value (specifically string value)
// You are printing a value on cosole here.

// Variable Declaration
let firstName = "Divyansh";
console.log(firstName); // here we are using the variable to recall the value stored inside.
// Note : whenever a variable is encountred it gets replaced my its value and that's what will be printed out.

// Nameing convention for variables
// camelCase : firstName (I prefer this) (preferred in JS)
// snake_case : first_name

// a variable name in js can only have letters, number, underscore and dollrs
// numbers at the start of a variable name is illegal in js
// keywords are also not allowed like : new, function, etc.
// keep your variables descript enough but not super long


// Also as per js nameing convention,
// done't use title case variable names as as a convention they are used of classes, which will learn more latter.
// Also a variable name with all upper case character is considered as a constant by convention and should be used accordingly.
// please note there two are convention and not illegal.

let PI = 3.14; // PI should be used as a constant not a variable by convention.
