// Here you can understand the difference between var and let as well, var is functional scope and let is block scope, try defining century with let inside if and else block and see whats the result and do the same wiht var and see whats the result.
// var would work as it make the variable live within the functional scope, not block scope.
// But let is recommended to use as it forces you to provide better code.
// And no worries we'll visit this again.
